                                Patience is the wise warrior&apos;s strongest virtue. It will guard you from wounds as
                                surely as armor. It will give you insight that others are less keen to seek out. Now,
                                recall the fight you just witnessed and ask yourselves what quality Talis lacked, and
                                what that lack cost her. She&apos;ll be nursing her new wounds for days, simply because
                                she could not wait for an opening.

                                <strong>Toval Argensente</strong> is a descendant of the Norfeld, a tribal people who
                                migrated south from the Ice Wilds millennia ago. Her pure-blooded Norfeld
                                features&mdash;ice-white skin, hair, and eyes&mdash;are a rarity these days, especially
                                in the kingdoms of Lensing.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Toval is a lieutenant in the Auerstel soldiery, and is responsible for training new
                                recruits. <CustomLink to="/gallery/pendrake">Pendrake</CustomLink> has never taken to
                                his training and, as such, has become a constant thorn in Toval&apos;s side.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As far as Toval is concerned, Pendrake&apos;s noble status means nothing on the training
                                grounds, and she disciplines his lack of commitment as harshly as she would any other
                                soldier under her command.

                                Do you know what we&apos;ve lost, Pendrake? Warend Joring is the duke of Torencald. The
                                trade agreements I meant to draft between our duchies would have enriched the Sommers
                                for generations and made both us and the Jorings two of the most powerful families in
                                Dayle. I&apos;ve spent years building to this point, and in a single evening you&apos;ve
                                managed to dash it all away. And for what, Pendrake? For a gods-damned scullion? Your
                                children and your children&apos;s children will be dead and buried long before
                                we&apos;ve heard the last echoes of this scandal.

                                Pendrake Sommer is less of a fighter than his sister, and far more of a romantic. Some

                                currently writing, <i>The Ashes of Hope</i>. She is the lady of the Tersing duchy,
                                daughter of the duke and sister to the heir of the dukedom.
                            </p>

                                Unlike her noble contemporaries, Talis prefers to spend her time honing her skills with
                                a saber and bow. As such, she&apos;s earned the admiration and respect of her peers in
                                the soldiery.

                                In stark contrast with her brother, Talis is highly disciplined and dedicates herself
                                fully to everything she pursues. Some have even speculated that she should be the heir
                                instead of her brother.

                                    The Ravens still exist, if you can believe it. Though they take a different form
                                    today. Different stories tell it different ways, but I prefer to believe they linger
                                    as men now, having forgotten all they once were.
